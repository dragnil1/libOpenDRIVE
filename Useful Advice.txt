Let's say we want to add first.cpp file and run it. First of all we have to build the project as described. Here is a recap:
	> mkdir build && cd build
	> cmake ..
	> make
Ok. Now we have our library built. Now lets add the first.cpp to the top most directory where test.cpp is located. Now open the CMakeLists.txt and add the following 
	> add_executable(first first.cpp)
	> target_link_libraries(first OpenDrive)
Here we are creating the object file named first from the first.cpp and linking it to the OpenDrive library.
Now you run the following:
	> cd build && make && cd ..
This will compile the first.cpp and make the object file. You will find it in the build directory. Now run the following assuming first.cpp does not require any 
command line argument:
	> ./build/first
